Fullstack React Coding Challenge
Overview

This challenge is designed to test your frontend development skills, focusing on React.

Additionally you can optionally chose to showcase your fullstack abilities by implementing a lightweight backend with CRUD API's to simulate a real database.

The task is to build a simple Project Management app where users can view, add, update, and delete projects.

üçÉ This challenge is intentionally scoped to be realistic but not overly complex.
üéØ What You Need to Build

Develop a simple Project Management UI with the following features:
User Stories

    As a user, I can see a list of all my saved projects.
    As a user, I can add a new project (must include at least a name and description).
    As a user, I can edit an existing project.
    As a user, I can delete a project.

UI Requirements

    List projects in a clean and readable layout.
    Include forms for adding and editing projects.

‚úÖ Bonus Features (Optional)

    Search/filter projects by name.
    Add a "project status" (e.g., Active, Completed, On Hold).
    Add form validation (e.g., name is required).
    Show user-friendly error messages on API failure.
    Add loading spinners or visual indicators for API calls.
    Create reusable components.

üìÅ Deliverables

Please provide:

    A link to a GitHub repo or zipped project folder.
    A short README.md describing:
        How to run the app. Your only assumption is that the user has Node.js installed.
        Any decisions, challenges, or improvements you'd make with more time

üß† What We‚Äôre Evaluating

    Ability to structure React components and manage state
    Ability to create a visually appealing and user-friendly UI
    Clean and maintainable code
    Basic error handling and data validation
    Understanding of component reusability
    React best practices

üìù Notes

We have deliberately left out detailed instructions on the following:

    What a project should look like (name, description, etc.)
    How the application should be styled (any CSS framework or custom styles)
    What packages you should and should not use (feel free to use any libraries or tools you prefer)

The reason for this is to allow you to showcase your creativity and problem-solving skills. We want to see how you approach building a functional and visually appealing application. Any design decisions or assumptions you make should be documented.

If you have any questions or trouble with the setup, feel free to ask before or during the challenge. Good luck-and have fun building!
